##### A simple to use Worley noise generator written fully in JavaScript. The module is both embeddable and customizable. The module works both in the browser,  web workers and node. The module can be instanced via CommonJS, AMD or `script` tags.  Module written and implemented with ES6 promises in mind.  This module has **ZER0** dependencies whatsoever.

  ```

- Node: 

  ```javascript
  const Worley = require("worleyjs");
  ```

## **Usage**

The module exposes a `Worley`  class. The `Worley` instance contains all the methods and properties needed for the generation of Worley noise.

##### Basic.

- The `crests` property defines how many `"spots"` there are in the texture.
- The `threshold` argument dictates how far the slope of a crest extends. It is optional and when not passed a value is calculated using the `width`, `height` and `crests` values.
  - <img src="https://github.com/sokorototo/worley-noise/blob/master/media/moving.gif?raw=true" style="zoom: 50%;" />  # Threshold as it changes from 120 to 30
- The `seed` argument is an array of 4 numbers which are seed to the RNG of the Texture.

```javascript
let noise = new Worley({
    width: 256, // In pixels
    height: 256, // In pixels
    threshold: 120,
    crests: 15,
    seed: [12345, 45678, 67890, 12345]
});

// Full texture access
noise.Texture.ImageData().then((imgData) => {
    // Do something like ctx.putImageData(imgData)
    
    console.log(imgData); // {width: Number ,height: Number ,data: Uint8Array => [0,1,2....n]
})
```

That produces the following texture.
‚Äã	<img src="https://github.com/sokorototo/worley-noise/blob/master/media/monochrome.png?raw=true" style="zoom: 80%;" /> # A basic 256x256 monochrome Worley noise texture.


#### Advanced.

- **Colour:** To add colour to the texture simply pass a `color`parameter with an array containing colour data for the first and second colour.

  ```javascript
  // RGB
  { color: [[4, 131, 228], [4, 228, 49]]}
  ```

  <img src="https://github.com/sokorototo/worley-noise/blob/master/media/colors.png?raw=true" style="zoom: 80%;" /> # Custom Colours.

- **Transparency:** To include the transparency to your texture. For more detailed transparency, pass a number to the `alpha` property where **0** is for no alpha influence and 1 is for full alpha influence. A number above **1** will overshoot the alpha and a value of **255** turns the texture fully transparent.

  ```javascript
  // Transparency
  { alpha: true}
  ```

  <img src="https://github.com/sokorototo/worley-noise/blob/master/media/alpha.png?raw=true" style="zoom:80%;" /> # Alpha On.

- **Interpolation:** You can *"turn off"* interpolation for a little **(mostly insignificant)** speed boost. This doesn't actually turn off interpolation but rather uses bilinear interpolation ( simple distance from a point ) to calculate values. üòÅ. It also disables custom interpolation functions.

  ```javascript
  // Toggle interpolation
  { interpolate: false }
  ```

  <img src="https://github.com/sokorototo/worley-noise/blob/master/media/interpolation_off.png?raw=true" style="zoom:80%;" /> # Interpolation Off, Compare with above texture.

- **Custom Interpolation Functions:**  To pass a custom interpolation function, simply pass a compatible function to the `interpolant` property in the config object of the noise instance. The `interpolate`  property needs to be set to true for this to work. The `interpolant` function takes three numbers. A lower value, an upper value and a *slider* value( which ranges from 1 to 0 ). With this function crazy effects can be achieved like belts, spots and cat fur patterns. *Expected* behaviour is that the slider defines a point on an interpolation curve, thus the closer the slider is to `0` the closer it is to the lower end of the graph, what the function does is simply **define the shape of the curve**. This is *expected* behaviour, you can obviously do whatever you want in the interpolant value, as long as it abides to the following rules:

  - Always returns a number.
  - Returned values are always clamped between the lower and upper values.

  ```javascript
  {
      interpolant: function(lower, upper, slider){
          // Simple cut-off interpolant
          if( slider >= 0.2 ){
              return upper
          } else {
              return lower
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Toggle various distance metrics** metrics: Manhattan, Euclidean and Minkowski distance metrics are supported.

  ```javascript
  // Euclidean
  { metric: {type: "euclidean"} };
  
  // Manhattan
  { metric: {type: "manhattan"} };
  
  // Minkowski takes a second parameter, p: Number
  { metric: {type: "minkowski", p: 2} };
  ```
  
  
  
- **Manually add a crest:** To add a crest manually to a point in the texture, use relative coordinates from `0 - 1`:

  ```javascript
  // This adds a spot|crest to the centre of the texture using relative co-ordinates.
  noise.addCrest(0.5, 0.5);
  
  // To add a point using absolute co-ordinates.
  noise.addCrest(120, 100, false);
  ```
  
- **Value Of A Given Pixel:** To get the value of a single pixel. Given the x and y co-ordinates.

  ```javascript
  // noise.pixel(x: in pixels, y: in pixels, ?interpolate, ?hierachy: which crest to consider first) 
  // returns a promise which resolves to a number between 0 and 255
  noise.pixel(50, 50, true, 2).then((value) => {
      // Do something
      
      console.log(value);
  })
  ```

- **Raw Data:** To access the raw noise values and not the RGBA texture.

  ```javascript
  // Raw single channel noise data. Stored as an Uint8Array ( a typed array of Unsigned 8-bit integers ).
  noise.Texture.generate().then((raw) => {
      // Do something with the data
      
      console.log(raw);// Uint8Array[100,24, 53,24....n]
  })
  ```

- **Nearby Crest**: If you want to find the closest "crest" given a set of co-ordinates.

  ```javascript
  // X, Y, ?hierachy
  noise.nearestCrest(x, y, 0).then((crest) => {
      // Outputs an array containing 2d co-ordinates in pixels
      console.log(crest); // -> [45, 56]
  })
  ```
